#Open Refine

[Open Refine](http://openrefine.org/) is your best friend when working with messy data, as well as exploring what's in a dataset.

##Typical use case
Refine is a great tool that has many advantages, from running offline to being very easy to use, while staying very, very powerful.

Generally, Refine can be used to both *clean a dataset* and/or *explore a dataset.* When you grab a new dataset from somewhere, it is probably a good idea to open it in Refine first to have a look at it. 

The list of things you can do with Refine is immensely long, but it is an **amazing** software. Do take the time to read one of the tutorials listed under.

##Installation and use
Refine is provided under the form of an application, not an online service, although it will run in your favourite browser.

Check the [Downloads](http://openrefine.org/download.html) section on Refine's website. 

*Kits* for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux are provided, and some basic instructions are listed [on the project's page](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Installation-Instructions).
